# Boilerplate Node Webkit set up using grunt

This boilerplate uses [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/) and grunt to automate your app build.

This boilerplate uses grunt to compile your sass, sets up a development server locally and builds out the app as required. Its a perfect starting point to get up and running with your desktop app.

## Set up
In order to run this boilerplate up and running run through theses installation steps first.
1. `$ npm install` — To get all the dependencies for grunt.
2. `$ bower install` — To get all the dependencies for bower.

## Running the project
Run `grunt` on the command line and the project will build itself, set up a server, open the index page, and wait for you to make changes. This is useful to develop your app in chrome before building out the project.

## Building the project
Once you're happy with everything, run `grunt build` and it will compile into your app folder. 
Navigate to the app folder in the project to view your application.
